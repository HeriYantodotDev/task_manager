# Simple Task Manager

This is a simple task manager that I created using Ruby on Rails. (Part of my learning Journey)

Here are the steps to use this repository: 

1. Install PostgreSQL first. I recommend this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-postgresql-with-your-ruby-on-rails-application-on-ubuntu-18-04)
2. Then please set your PostgreSQL in the environment variable:
`echo 'export TASK_MANAGER_DATABASE_PASSWORD="PostgreSQL_Role_Password"' >> ~/.bashrc` 

Then 

`source ~/.bashrc` 
3. Open the terminal in the root folder then enter this line `rails s`
4. Open in the browser: `http://localhost:3000/`
